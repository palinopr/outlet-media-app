# Canvas Design

Create visual art as .png and .pdf documents using design philosophy. Use when asked to create a poster, piece of art, design, or other static visual piece. Create original visual designs rather than copying existing artists' work.

## Two-Step Process

1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)
2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf or .png file)

## Step 1: Design Philosophy Creation

Create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:
- Form, space, colour, composition
- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns
- Minimal text as visual accent

### Generating a Visual Philosophy

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Brutalist Joy" / "Chromatic Silence" / "Metabolist Dreams"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) expressing how it manifests through:
- Space and form
- Colour and material
- Scale and rhythm
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy

**Guidelines:**
- Avoid redundancy -- each design aspect mentioned once
- Emphasise craftsmanship repeatedly: the final work should appear meticulously crafted, laboured over with care, the product of deep expertise
- Leave creative space for interpretive choices

### Philosophy Examples

**"Concrete Poetry"**: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry. Massive colour blocks, sculptural typography, Brutalist spatial divisions. Text as rare, powerful gesture.

**"Chromatic Language"**: Colour as the primary information system. Geometric precision where colour zones create meaning. Typography minimal. Josef Albers meets data visualisation.

**"Analog Meditation"**: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room. Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Japanese photobook aesthetic.

**"Organic Systems"**: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns. Rounded forms, organic arrangements, colour from nature. Information shown through visual diagrams and spatial relationships.

### Essential Principles

- **Visual Philosophy**: Create an aesthetic worldview expressed through design
- **Minimal Text**: Text is sparse, essential-only, integrated as visual element
- **Spatial Expression**: Ideas communicate through space, form, colour -- not paragraphs
- **Pure Design**: Art objects, not documents with decoration
- **Expert Craftsmanship**: Final work must look meticulously crafted

## Step 2: Canvas Creation

With both philosophy and conceptual framework established, create the visual work.

Use repeating patterns and shapes. Treat the abstract philosophical design as if it were a scientific bible -- borrowing the visual language of systematic observation: dense accumulation of marks, repeated elements, layered patterns that build meaning through patient repetition.

Add sparse, clinical typography and systematic reference markers. Anchor the piece with simple phrases positioned subtly, using a limited colour palette that feels intentional and cohesive.

### Text Guidelines

- Text is always minimal and visual-first
- Let context guide scale: a punk venue poster might have larger, more aggressive type than a minimalist ceramics studio identity
- Use different, interesting fonts -- search for appropriate typefaces
- Nothing falls off the page. Nothing overlaps. Every element contained within canvas boundaries with proper margins
- Make typography part of the art itself

### Quality Bar

Create work that looks like it took countless hours. Ensure composition, spacing, colour choices, and typography all demonstrate expert-level craftsmanship. Double-check that nothing overlaps, formatting is flawless, every detail is perfect.

Output as a single downloadable .pdf or .png file, alongside the design philosophy as a .md file.

### Refinement Pass

After initial creation, take a second pass:
- Do not add more graphics. Refine what exists
- Make it extremely crisp, respecting the design philosophy
- Ask: "How can I make what's already here more of a piece of art?"

## Multi-Page Option

When additional pages are requested, create distinctly different pages following the same design philosophy. Treat the first page as one page in a coffee table book. Make subsequent pages unique twists on the original, almost telling a story in a tasteful way.
